While ADTMC is the only authorized screening algorithm, this product is not sponsored by any Government or DoD agency,
nor should it be used for medical purposes without the express permission of your credentialed provider.

**DISCLAIMER**
ADTMC currently does not have any algorithm regarding headache. Until at which point it is created, that algorithm is blank
