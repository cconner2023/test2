# ADTMC --
Algorithm Directed Troop Medical Care MEDCOM PAM 40-7-21 to provide triage and self-care protocols if applicable. I attempted to stay verbatim from the MEDCOM PAM.

# UPDATE --
(1) Users can now search for algorithm, symptom, differential, and medications.
(2) Decision Making is separated by differential and ancillary orders are listed if applicable.
(3) Share note via encoded text or PDF417 barcode
(4) Save note locally - visible in settings / 'My Notes'
(5) Import note - can scan PDF417 barcode or input encoded text. Users can save external notes or copy/paste into the EHR if local policy accepts this input.
(6) Toggle theme - dark mode for us vampires is in settings


# USAGE --
ALWAYS consult your attending physician; Always refer to local SOP if unsure of something.
Never prescribe a medication you don't understand.
Always double check.

This was built without PII/PHI, and I cannot guarantee security. Patient safety is top priority - be respectful of HIPAA and their right to privacy.

Be safe, be legal, be smart, but go nuts.
