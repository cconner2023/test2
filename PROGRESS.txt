A react, vite, ts PWA meant for triage and documentation.
RESTRICTIONS:
    - do not edit data in \Data. This comes from outside sources and is verbatim.

Upon new context we are to review the code base, complete Todo, and update progress in this txt file.

Completed:
[1] mobile view drawers @MedicationDrawer @Settings @WriteNotePage @NoteImport extend beyond the island. 
    - Reduced partial height from 50dvh to 40dvh and full height from 98dvh to 90dvh across all 4 drawers
[2] maintain state of @AlgorithmPage upon window re-size.
    - Unified mobile/desktop into a single AlgorithmPage instance with dynamic isMobile prop so state persists

New Issues:
[1] Any action (select, scroll) in our mobile drawers raises it to full visibility.
