Refactor — Progress Log
=================================================

A PWA for expediting triage and medic documentation. Data verbatim from Army doctrine.

## RESTRICTIONS --
# 1 do not edit data, overal functionality, or UI without explicit instructions to do so
# 2 Ensure code is readable, maintainable, and has no duplicates
# 3 do not run build or deploy. you can use npm run dev to check for TS errors
# 3 review your changes upon completion, and clean up any dead or orphaned code. 

## FEATURE BACKLOG --
=================================================
# 1 [DONE] ->  Adjust WriteNotePage note wizard: Consolidated from 3 pages (Write Note / View Note / Share Note) to 2 pages (Write Note / Review & Share). Page 1 now combines a collapsible note preview with inline copy, the barcode display, and a horizontal action button row (Copy, Share, Save/Save Changes/Delete) consistent with My Notes action bar styling. Removed orphaned CopyButton helper component. All existing functionality preserved.
=================================================
# 2 [DONE] -> AlgorithmPage.tsx note type header: Moved note status header (New/Saved/External) out of the scroll container and into a shrink-0 flex sibling above the scrollable area. Header now remains fixed at the top of the AlgorithmPage while content scrolls beneath it. Mobile safe area padding preserved on the header wrapper.
=================================================
# 3 [DONE] -> Settings -> My Notes action menu: Added env(safe-area-inset-bottom) padding to the bottom action bar container on mobile, ensuring buttons display above the iOS home indicator / safe zone.
=================================================
# 4 [DONE] -> Remove redundant note tag on disposition: Removed the note status badge (Saved/External/New) from the AlgorithmPage disposition card since the sticky header already displays this information.
=================================================
# 5 [DONE] -> Note tag header card styling: Restyled the sticky note status header to resemble a card (bg-themewhite2, border-tertiary/10, shadow-sm, rounded-md). Text changed to text-primary. Added mb-3 for spacing before the first algorithm card. Mobile horizontal padding applied to the wrapper.
