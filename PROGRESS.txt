A react, vite, ts PWA meant for triage and documentation.
RESTRICTIONS:
    - do not edit data in \Data. This comes from outside sources and is verbatim.

Upon new context we are to review the code base, complete Todo, and update progress in this txt file.

Completed:
[1] mobile view drawers @MedicationDrawer @Settings @WriteNotePage @NoteImport extend beyond the island. 
    - Reduced partial height from 50dvh to 40dvh and full height from 98dvh to 90dvh across all 4 drawers
[2] maintain state of @AlgorithmPage upon window re-size.
    - Unified mobile/desktop into a single AlgorithmPage instance with dynamic isMobile prop so state persists
[3] Any action (select, scroll) in our mobile drawers raises it to full visibility.
    - Fixed: Restricted drag handlers to only the drag handle/header via data-drag-zone attribute
    - Fixed: Removed touchAction:'none' from full container so content scrolls natively
    - Fixed: Changed partial→full expansion to require deliberate upward swipe velocity only (removed drawerPosition>70 check that always triggered since position starts at 100)
    - Applied to MedicationsDrawer, Settings, NoteImport, and WriteNotePage

New ToDos
[1] Implement consistent mobile drawer appearances with SymptomInfoDrawer identical to the WriteNotePage mobile drawer
[2] Review useAlgorithm for appearance of question cards. In Algorithm.ts there is often an item that says 'red flags' which should correspond to the selection of red flags. We need to see that item selected if present when red flags are selected.
[3] useAlgorithm error with correcting red flags or initial questions and resetting subsequent card.
[4] action card answeroptions in QuestionCard.tsx should not be selectable

AutoForge Feature Verification Session (2/8/2025):
- Feature #1 (App loads without console errors): PASSED - App loads cleanly with 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Feature #31 (Theme persists in localStorage): PASSED - Theme toggle works, localStorage stores preference, persists across reload
- Current progress: 2/52 features passing (3.8%)
- Feature #2 (All categories render in main list): PASSED - All 13 categories (A-M) render correctly with icons, names, colors. Desktop grid layout and mobile single-column layout verified. Auto-animate applied.
- Feature #3 (Navigation bar with search and menu): PASSED - NavTop renders at top with search input (desktop) / search icon (mobile), hamburger menu (mobile), dynamic title updates on navigation (main→category→algorithm). Navbar is fixed/sticky at top on both layouts.
- Current progress: 4/52 features passing (7.7%)
- Feature #4 (Category selection shows subcategory symptoms): PASSED - Clicking a category transitions to subcategory view showing symptoms. Verified on both desktop and mobile. NavTop title updates to category name on mobile. Back button returns to main view. Tested with EAR NOSE THROAT (5 subcats) and GASTROINTESTINAL (7 subcats). Data matches CatData.
- Feature #7 (Selecting a symptom navigates to algorithm page): PASSED - Clicking a subcategory symptom navigates to AlgorithmPage with correct triage algorithm. Verified with Back Pain (B-1): Red Flags card displayed with 8 flags, choice card with YES/NO. NavTop title updates to symptom name. Info button appears on mobile. Zero console errors.
- Current progress: 6/53 features passing (11.3%)
