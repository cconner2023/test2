081-000-0061 Perform Patient Suctioning
=========================================
Evaluation Preparation: You must evaluate the Soldiers on their performance of this task in an operational condition related to the actual task.
Performance Measures:
1 Prepared equipment.
2 Explained the procedure to the patient, if conscious.
3 Donned personal protective equipment.
4 Positioned the patient.
5 Hyperoxygenated the patient with 100% oxygen.
6 Tested the patency of the catheter.
7 Suctioned the patient.
8 Reoxygenated the patient or ventilated for at least five assisted ventilations, as appropriate.
9 Observed the patient for signs of hypoxemia.
10 Placed the patient in a position of comfort.
11 Recorded the procedure on the SF 600 or EMR.

Evaluation Guidance: Score each Soldier according to the performance measures in the evaluation guide. Training instructor determines if the entire task will be trained and evaluated or parts, based on a Soldier’s military occupational specialty or assigned position and available equipment.

081-68W-0230 Place an Intermediate Airway Device
=================================================
Evaluation Preparation: You must evaluate the Soldiers on their performance of this task in an operational condition related to the actual task.
Performance Measures:
GO
NO GO
1 Took BSI precautions.
2 Inspected the upper airway for visible obstruction.
3 Directed assistant to hyperventilate the patient for a minimum of 30 seconds.
4 Tested cuff and inflation system for leaks by injecting the maximum recommended volume of air into the cuffs (size 3: 60 milliliter [ml], size 4: 80 ml, size 5: 90 ml).
5 Removed all air from both cuffs prior to insertion.
6 Applied lubricant to beveled distal tip and posterior aspect of the tube.
7 Positioned the head in the “sniffing” position. Verbalized alternate position was the “neutral” position.
8 Held the supraglottic airway device at the connector with dominant hand. With nondominant hand performed a tongue and chin lift.
9 Introduced tip into mouth and advanced behind base of tongue.
10 Passed the supraglottic airway device towards the back of tongue, rotated tube back to midline (blue orientation line faces chin).
11 Advanced tube until base of connector was aligned with teeth or gums.
12 Used the syringe provided, inflated the cuffs of the supraglottic airway device with the appropriate volume of air (size 3: 45-60 ml, size 4: 60-80 ml, size 5: 70-90 ml).
13 Attached the BVM to the supraglottic airway device. While gently bagging the patient to assess ventilation, simultaneously withdrew the supraglottic airway device until ventilation was easy and free flowing (large tidal volume with minimal airway pressure).
14 Directed the combat lifesaver to ventilate casualty with the BVM, auscultated lung fields and watched for rise and fall of the chest to confirm tube placement. Attached a pulse oximeter.
15 Secured device to the casualty.
16 Documented information onto DD Form 1380, SF 600, or EMR.
17 Removed subglottic airway device from the protective cradle.
18 Opened the patient’s airway with the head tilt chin lift.
19 Inserted the subglottic airway device by grasping the device by the bite block and introducing the leading soft tip into the mouth of the patient towards the hard palate.
20 Secured the device with tape or securing strap.
21 Monitored end tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) and attached pulse oximeter to patient.
22 Documented information onto DD Form 1380, SF 600, or EMR.

Evaluation Guidance: Score each Soldier according to the performance measures in the evaluation guide. Unless otherwise stated in the task summary, the Soldier must pass all performance measures to be scored GO. If the Soldier fails any step, show what was done wrong and how to do it correctly.
