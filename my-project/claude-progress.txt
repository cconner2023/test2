CLAUDE PROGRESS NOTES - PackageBackEnd
===============================================================================

Session: 2026-02-15
Feature: #1 - Database connection established (Supabase PostgreSQL)
Status: PASSING ✓

What was accomplished:
- Added Supabase client initialization logging to src/lib/supabase.ts
  - Logs URL, anon key status, and client creation success
- Added checkSupabaseConnection() health check function
  - Performs lightweight query against Supabase REST API
  - Handles table-not-found (PGRST205) gracefully as "connection OK"
  - Reports latency in milliseconds
- Added startup connection check in src/main.tsx
  - Non-blocking async check runs on app load
  - Logs connection status to console

Verification results:
- Console logs confirmed:
  [Supabase] Initializing client...
  [Supabase] URL: https://rkkyhhxcsqwyxwrpfrle.supabase.co
  [Supabase] Anon key loaded: yes
  [Supabase] Client created successfully
  [Supabase] Connection verified (384ms) — database responding
  [App] Supabase database connection established (384ms)
- Zero console errors
- No mock data patterns found in src/
- App renders correctly on http://localhost:5175/test2/

Important notes for next sessions:
- Database schema (001_initial_schema.sql) has NOT been applied yet
  - The profiles table returns PGRST205 (not in PostgREST schema cache)
  - Schema SQL is ready in supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
  - Needs to be applied via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor or CLI with access token
  - This is required for Feature #2 (Database schema applied correctly)
- Supabase CLI is installed (v2.76.8) but no access token configured
  - Run `npx supabase login` to authenticate, then `npx supabase link` and `npx supabase db push`
- Dev server runs on port 5175 (5173 and 5174 were in use)
- Base path is /test2/

Current completion: 1/86 features passing (1.2%)

Session: 2026-02-15 (session 2)
Feature: #4 - No mock data patterns in codebase
Status: PASSING ✓

What was accomplished:
- Ran all 7 required grep checks from the feature steps
- Ran 5 additional deep-scan grep checks for thoroughness
- All checks passed — codebase is clean of mock data patterns

Detailed results:
1. globalThis. in src/ → No matches ✅
2. dev-store/devStore/mockDb in src/ → No matches ✅
3. mockData/testData/fakeData/sampleData/dummyData in src/ → No matches ✅
4. TODO.*real/TODO.*database/STUB/MOCK in src/ → No matches ✅
5. isDevelopment/isDev/process.env.NODE_ENV in src/ → No matches ✅
6. new Map()/new Set() in src/ → Found but benign:
   - CatData.ts: temp Map for data transformation (not a data store)
   - MyNotesPanel.tsx: React useState for UI selection tracking (not a data store)
7. json-server/miragejs/msw in package.json → No matches ✅

Extra checks (all clean):
- stub/mock/fake/dummy (case-insensitive) → No matches
- TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX → No matches
- in-memory/inMemory patterns → Only benign comment in ThemeContext
- placeholder/hardcoded → Only HTML attrs and algorithm data content
- localhost fetch patterns → No matches
- window.* usage → All standard browser API (matchMedia, setTimeout, etc.)

Notes:
- Algorithms.ts has "[ACT2 PLACEHOLDER]" and "action placeholder" in medical
  data content — these are verbatim from PAM 40-7-21 reference, not code placeholders
- No code changes were required — codebase was already clean

Current completion: 2/86 features passing (2.3%)
